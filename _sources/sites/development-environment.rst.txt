Development
###########

This chapter concerns documentation related to the development of the MDS-Desktop app not the use of it by endusers.

Development Environment
=======================

This chapter provides instructions on how to setup the recommended development environment for the MDS-Desktop project.
The MDS-Desktop app is built, on top of :vite-electron-builder-homepage:`vite-electron-builder <>` as an :electron-homepage:`Electron <>` application which uses :vue-homepage:`Vue.js <>` to render the ui and :vite-homepage:`Vite <>` to build the vue.js application.
As an Electron app this application is built on top of :node-homepage:`Node.js <>` and uses the :npm-homepage:`npm <>` package manager for dependency management and the build process.

Setup Development Environment
-----------------------------

First you need to setup Node.js and npm if you haven't already.
To install both download and execute the :node-installer:`Node.js Installer <>` or use a :node-pm-installer:`package manager <>` for the installation, if available.

Next if you just want to run the MDS-Desktop app you can clone the regular repository using:

.. code-block:: sh

    git clone https://github.com/mobile-directing-system/mds-desktop.git

If you want to contribute however, you need to create a fork of the regular repository and clone the fork instead.
Finish setting up the app by changing into the root directory of the repository and run ``npm i``.
To run the app in dev mode with HMR for most parts of the app run ``npm run watch``.
Lasty to run the app in productiion mode with the statically compiled vue ui run ``npm run prod``.

You can use any Editor you like to work with the app but we strongly recommend :vscode-homepage:`VSCode <>`.
This editor enable comfortable development by providing a number of extensions that help with the developement.
Recommended extensions for working on the app are *npm Intellisense*, *Vue Language Features*, *ESLint* and *Tailwind CSS IntelliSense*.

Technolgies & Architecture
==========================

This chapter covers used technologies, theirs docs, if necessary how they are used and the architecture of the MDS-Desktop app.

Technologies
------------

For this :electron-homepage:`Electron <>` app we use :vue-homepage:`Vue.js <>` as the web framework with :tailwind-homepage:`tailwindcss <>` and :flowbite-homepage:`Flowbite <>` as the UI framework and the logic is writtin in Typescript.
For routing we use :vue-router-homepage:`vue-router <>`.
For state management of the UI we use :vuex-homepage:`vuex <>` with the :vuex-smart-module-homepage:`vuex-smart-module <>` to have TypeScript support.
We use :lodash-homepage:`Lodash <>` as a utitlity library in the frontend.
The vue app the UI uses :vite-homepage:`Vite <>` for building and bundling.
The communication with the backend is implemented using :axios-homepage:`Axios <>`.

Architecture
------------

As an Electron app the MDS-Desktop app is split into three parts. 
The first is the Website which defines the UI, for which we use a web app developed in vue.
The second is the Preload Module which defines what Node.js functionality is usable from the web app.
Here we use is mainly to expose wrapper functions around the IPC calls to the Node.js part of the app.
Lastly there is the Node.js part. This part starts & configures the browser windows to display the web app and implements other functionality not available to JS in the browser such as access to the files on the computer.

The Vue UI app is split between the router, views, components and the vuex state.
The app is structured by using the router to route between different views.
These views themselves are made up of components, HTML and Typescript.
Those components them are made up similary to the view, but in contrast to the views they are supposed to be usable at multiple points in the application.
We decide on which functionality to put into a component based on if it is going to be reused or not.
The data which is displayed by the UI is taken from vuex which we use to manage the state of our app.

.. warning:: Both views and components are written in the *SFC* format using Vue3 with the Composition API. We also use Typescript and the `<script setup>` tag for our code. When ever possible try to use those technolgies and make sure that when browsing the :vue-doc:`Vue.js Documentation <>` you have the toggle at the top of the sidebar set to Composition API.

To get started with Vue.js take a look at the :vue-doc:`Vue.js Documentation <>`.
For an introduction to the vue-router visit the :vue-router-guide:`vue-router Guide <>`.
To get a general understanding of vuex you can orient yourself at the :vuex-guide:`vuex Guide <>`.
But we use the vuex-smart-module to gain TypeScript support for vuex and used the README in the :vuex-smart-module-github:`vuex-smart-module Github <>` orient ourself when writing our vuex module.

The Preload Module is mostly autmated and only conists of wrapper functions to expose the IPC calls to the vue app.
But here it is **Important** to note that the auto-export plugin currently is bugged and needs all of the functions you want to export to be on a seperate line and in a seperate export statement.
If this is not done the vue app will not be able to find the preload module.

We use the Node.js part mostly to implement the skaffolding of the app (e.g. start browser window with the web app and hide window bar, implement exit window function, etc.) and the IPC, Handler and client-side implementation of the MDS-Server HTTP API.
To Familiarize youself with Electron you can use the :electron-intro:`Electron Introduction <>`.

Minimal Implementation for new Service
--------------------------------------

To implement a minimal service for a new entity (e.g. User, Group, etc.) do the following:

#. Start with implementing the calls to the backend API using Axios in *main/src/backend*. Once implemented export them in the *main/src/backend/index.ts* file.
#. Use them to write a handler-wrapper in *main/src/ipcHandlers*. Export these handlers in the *main/src/ipcHandlers/index.ts*.
#. Register these handlers in ipcMain in *main/src/index.ts* and give them speaking names.
#. Write a wrapper functions for calling those ipcHandlers in *preload/src* and export them in *preload/src/index.ts*.

   .. warning:: Make sure that the names used for calling the ipcHandlers are **exactly** the same as the ones given to them when registering them. **Important** There is a bug with the auto-export plugin that requires you to export each wrapper function sperately on a new line. If this is not done the vue code can't find the preload module.

#. Lastly implement a seperate vuex module to manage the state of the retrieved entities. Use the preload wrapper functions to fetch data from the backend.

   .. warning:: When writing a new vuex module and utilizing the IPC wrapper exposed by the preload module it is necessary to *undom* the objects of the vuex state before they are passed to the wrapper function. If not electron will throw an error complaining that it cannot serialize the object. With *undom* we mean that you must create a deep copy of the object, so that only basic data types such as number, booleans and strings are copied. Also only fields specified in the type of the object must be copied, but not additional fields created at runtime. This means that if an object holds a reference to another object or array those must be deep copied as well.

Component Documentation
=======================

Documentation for the components themselves (in *packages/renderer/src/components*) can be found either as code comments in the components themselves or in the form of a :vuepress-homepage:`VuePress <>` documentation.
The vuepress documentation is written in markdown files in *docs/README.md* and *docs/component-docs/\**. To serve the documentation use the

.. code-block:: sh

    npm run docs:dev


command in the project root. If you want a statically built HTML version run 

.. code-block:: sh

    npm run docs:build

in the project root.

The vue components are documented with a general description of their use and particularities, as well as a list of their slots, events and props.

UI-Customization
================

As for customization of the standard TailwindCSS, we chose to only adapt the colors.

Custom Colors
-------------

For the implementation of our custom color theme we oriented ourselves at :tailwindcss-colors:`TailwindCSS Customizing Colors <>`.
As such the color definitions can be found in the either of the *tailwind.config.js* files.

.. warning:: If you want to change of extend the custom color theme please be aware that **both** *tailwind.config.js* files need to be changes for the changes to be reflected in the dev and production modes.

We chose to implement 6 different colors:

* primary: The primary color for e.g. normal buttons or other primary UI elements
* secondary: The secondary color for e.g. highlights etc or other secondary UI elements
* warning: The warning color for things the user should perceive more than the standard UI, but is not an error
* error: The error color displayed when e.g. an error occurs or form fields are not filled correctly
* surface: The color for e.g. form fields to be more recognizable on the background or for delimiter
* background: The color for the background

Each of those colors as five different hues, except the background color:

* superlight
* light
* \-
* dark
* superdark

Those must can be combinied with the colors using an *_* to choose a color, e.g. *primary_superlight* is the superlight hue of the primary color.
If no hue is provides the normal middleground color is chosen.
The combinations themselves are taken from the default TailwindCSS color palatte, so they are a subset of this palatte.

Each of these color and hue combinations also has a *on_* color for text to be displayed readably on it.
E.g. for text on the background color it would be the color *on_background* or for text on the primary_superlight color *on_primary_superlight*

These colors can be combined with TailwindCSS designators such as *text* for text color or *bg* for background color. 
The colors are appended to those designators using a *-*, so when the primary color is wanted as a background color it is *bg-primary* with 
*text-on_primary* as the text color for it to be readable.
