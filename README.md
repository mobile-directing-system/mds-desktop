## About the project
To ensure that major events run smoothly, many emergency forces are involved. The emergency forces are coordinated by managers who sit in a mobile telecommunications center. For the coordination and documentation of the processes, notes on paper are often used in the telecommunication center. The aim of the project is to digitize the processes in order to be able to work more efficiently. In addition, the operations can be better tracked with the help of a digital solution.

The project is being developed as open source in order to give as many aid organizations as possible the opportunity to adapt and reuse the project for their own purposes.
